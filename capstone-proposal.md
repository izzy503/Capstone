### Name of Student:
Israel E Padilla

### Name of Project:
Jiu-Jitsu Catalog App

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The Jiu-Jitsu Catalog App allows users to catalog and track Jiu-Jitsu moves they've learned, categorizing them by gi or no-gi, and recording struggles and successes with each move.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
1. Add a new Jiu-Jitsu move with details (name, type, struggles, success).
2. View a list of all cataloged Jiu-Jitsu moves.

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, and/or other resources will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **JSON Server:** Simple backend server for data persistence.

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
1. **Move Details Page:** Create a page to display detailed information about a specific Jiu-Jitsu move.
2. **Update and Delete Moves:** Allow users to update or delete cataloged moves.
3. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own move catalogs.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- **React Router:** For navigation between different pages.
- **Backend Database (e.g., MongoDB):** For more robust data storage and user-specific catalogs.
- **Authentication Library (e.g., Firebase Authentication):** To handle user authentication.

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
This project aims to provide a simple and user-friendly platform for Jiu-Jitsu enthusiasts to document and reflect on their learning journey. The initial focus is on creating a functional MVP with basic features, and future enhancements will be geared towards improving the user experience and adding more advanced functionalities. I'm excited to receive feedback and guidance throughout the development process.
